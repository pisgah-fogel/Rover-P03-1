# 3D printing of the Rover

## Setup

I use a Prusa I3 MK2, you can bought one for less than 100 euros on Aliexpress.


I use FreeCAD for modeling, export it in `.stl`.


Then I use Cura to procI use Cura to process the `.stl` and either print with USB or copy it to a SD card and put it in my printer.
